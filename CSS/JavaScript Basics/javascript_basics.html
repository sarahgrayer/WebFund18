        <h2>JavaScript Basics</h2>
        <p>JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting languarge. JavaScript is extremely popular for a variety of reasons. It is a small and lightweight language allowing maximum flexibility for developers to take it in a bunch of different directions. JavaScript lives inside a host environment (a web browser or Node server), it can be connected to the objects of these environments to provide programmatic control over them.</p>
        <ul>
          <li><a>Variable Declaration</a> JavaScript variables are containers for storing data values - imagine a cup you fill with coffee, the cup h olds the coffee, a variable holds a value. All JavaScript variables must be identified with unique names. These unique names are dalled identifiers. <span style="color: #636bc3">var x;</span></li>
          <li><a>Variable Assignment</a> Assignment operators assign values to JavaScript variables - our cup can now have  coffee poured in it, giving our variable a value to hold. The = assignment operator assigns a value to a variable. <span style="color: #636bc3">var x = 10;</span></li>
          <li><a>Data Types</a> Data Types are an important concept; to be able to operate on variables you need to know the data type. There are six data types that are JavaScript primitives: Boolean - true or false; null - null aka nothing; Number - 42 or 3.14159; String - "Coding Dojo Rocks!"; Array, and Object - <span style="color: #636bc3">{first_name: 'Jane', last_name: "Doe"}</span></li>
          <li><a>Conditionals</a> When you write code, you want to perform different actions for different decisions - hitting different code blocks based on values or conditions that have been met. You can use conditional statements in your code to accomplish this. THere are the following conditional statements: <span style="color: #636bc3">if</span> a specified condition is true, do this code in our code block; <span style="color: #636bc3">else if</span> to specify a new condition to test, if the first condition is false; <span style="color: #636bc3">else</span> we execute this block of code;</li>
          <li><a>Loops</a> There are many different kinds of loops in every programming languarge, but they all essentially do the same thing: they will repeat an action some number of times. Imagine you have to run a mile, well you run around the track four times and then you stop. That's a loop!</li>
          <li><a>Function</a> Functions are an encaspulation of code block. When we call our function this will run that code block. Think of it as a list of instructions. As an example imagine we are putting together a desk from Ikea, we open up the instruction manual and get started, first we screw the legs to the table top; next we place the table the right way up. Done! We finished our instructions. Sadly there are a ton more tables to do so lets call our function over and over and over again.</li>
